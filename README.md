## üåê Deployment URL

Replace the placeholder below with your production app URL after deployment:

Deployment URL: https://your-deployment.example.com/your-zendesk-app

If you deploy with Zendesk's app hosting or a custom host, update the URL and the `iframe` entry in `manifest.json` accordingly.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run locally (development)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (12+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Zendesk CLI (`zcli`) ‚Äî used for serving and deploying the app

Install `zcli` globally (PowerShell / Windows example):

```powershell
npm install -g @zendesk/zcli
```

Serve the app locally (from the repository root):

```powershell
cd d:\Programming\zendesk-basic-app\hello-world
zcli apps:server
```

This command will start a local dev server and give you a URL to install the dev app into your Zendesk account (follow the prompts from `zcli`).

Deploy the app using `zcli`:

```powershell
zcli apps:deploy
```

See `zcli.apps.config.json` for environment-specific settings used during deploy.
